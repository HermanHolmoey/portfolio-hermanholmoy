        <p>My name is Herman Holmoey. I'm a 21 y/o guy from a small town in Norway called Aasgaardstrand. I have spent 20 years of my life in that city.</p>
        <p>Then I moved to Bergen August 2019, to start my student life on Noroff Bergen. Before all this I had two years off, just to work and travel.</p>
        <p>I have always had a passion for technology, computers, design and wanted to learn coding as well. Thats the reason I chose Noroff, and had some friends who was moving up to Bergen, so I went to Noroff Bergen.</p>
        <p>I'm a person who likes to be on the move, so I'm probably moving this year too. But the passion for programming will continue, probably not in Bergen. I don't have much experience with coding and programming, but really want to accomplish programming language.</p>
